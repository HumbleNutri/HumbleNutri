            To date, clinicians have implemented interventions in patient populations by either manually \
                designing meal plans (a burdensome and unscalable approach), or employing off-the-shelf meal planning applications (apps).\
                Existing apps on the market suffer a major limitation: while they account for dietary constraints, their meal recommendations\
                focus on Western-normative diets, and their approaches do not offer customization to other sociocultural dietary patterns (e.g., Hispanic foods).\
                This represents a major gap given that:
            - Populations commonly targeted in meal prescription interventions are of racial/ethnic minorities and may not have Western normative diets.
            - Extensive evidence from dietary interventions has established that dietary changes are sustainably maintained and lead to nutritional benefits only if the intervention works around individuals\' existing diets.

        To build HumbleNutri, we employ the HUMMUS<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>2</sup></a> dataset consisting of 2M reviews from 300K users over 500k recipes. For more details\
        check their [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/felix134/connected-recipe-data-set). HUMMUS is an aggregated dataset from various\
        sources. All recipes come from Food.com and include ingredients, nutrients, instructions, and tags (labels of meal types, such as breakfast, or cuisines, such as Italian), and several \
            calculated nutrition scores (WHO, FSA, NutriScore). Important for the recommendation model task, the dataset also includes reviews of these recipes from users, who may have multiple reviews. \
                Additional graphical structure behind these recipes is provided by using the knowledge graph FoodKG to map ingredients in the recipes as well as the recipe instructions to the FoodOn food ontology. \
        Since only 45% of the recipes in the dataset have tags, we use a self-training approach in semi-supervised fashion to label the entire recipe dataset by meal type (breakfast, appetizer, main dish, dessert, drink, or sauce). \
            We also create a label indicating whether the recipe is of a Latin American heritage style cuisine or not. We aggregated existing tags from all countries in Central and South America to create this category, which we then used to predict it across the dataset.
        Additional filters are applied to ensure all meals included fit within a general healthy dietary pattern, removing from the dataset recipes that have a low ‚ÄòNutriScore‚Äô (as calculated in the HUMMUS dataset), or include specific restricted ingredients (e.g., ‚Äòmargarine‚Äô) or preparation step (e.g., ‚Äòdeep-fry‚Äô). \

                The set of nutritional constraints for any patient is automatically computed by the app based on the information input by the medical provider on each patient‚Äôs clinical factors (sex, age, weight, height, and whether they have certain health conditions or are recovering from surgery). \
