            To date, clinicians have implemented interventions in patient populations by either manually \
                designing meal plans (a burdensome and unscalable approach), or employing off-the-shelf meal planning applications (apps).\
                Existing apps on the market suffer a major limitation: while they account for dietary constraints, their meal recommendations\
                focus on Western-normative diets, and their approaches do not offer customization to other sociocultural dietary patterns (e.g., Hispanic foods).\
                This represents a major gap given that:
            - Populations commonly targeted in meal prescription interventions are of racial/ethnic minorities and may not have Western normative diets.
            - Extensive evidence from dietary interventions has established that dietary changes are sustainably maintained and lead to nutritional benefits only if the intervention works around individuals\' existing diets.

        check their [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/felix134/connected-recipe-data-set). HUMMUS is an aggregated dataset from various\
        sources. Recipes include ingredients, nutrients, instructions, and tags (labels of meal types, such as breakfast, or cuisines, such as Italian), and several \
            calculated nutrition scores (WHO, FSA, NutriScore). The dataset also includes reviews of these recipes from users, who may have multiple reviews, which can be used for a recommendation task. \
        We utilized ~45% of the recipes in the dataset that have tags, and employ a self-training approach in semi-supervised fashion to label the entire recipe dataset by meal type (breakfast; appetizer, main dish, dessert, drink, or sauce). \
            We also create a label indicating whether the recipe is of a Latin American heritage style cuisine or not (This could be any other cuisine based on the patient population). We aggregated existing tags from all countries in Central and South America to create this category, which we then used to predict it across the dataset.
        Additional filters are applied before collaborative filtering step to ensure all meals included fit within a general healthy dietary pattern, removing the recipes that have a low ‚ÄòNutriScore‚Äô (as calculated in the HUMMUS dataset). \

        HumbleNutri is a multi-module system that generates culturally-tailored and clinically personalized meal recommendations for patients, guided by clinical nutrition principles and cultural relevance. The system works through integration of four modules: (1) a semi-supervised learning method to infer cuisine and meal type labels at scale to identify culturally relevant recipes; (2) collaborative filtering for recipe recommendation, (3) a "recipe alignment" step to reflect nutritionist-specified constraints on ingredients and preparation methods, and (4) a structured optimization framework to generate personalized weekly meal bundles. Following the guidance from the Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN), these modules are integrated to produce daily meal bundles structured into breakfast, lunch consisting of main-dish and 1 side-dish (vegetables), and dinner consisting of main-dish and 2 side-dishes (vegetables and whole grains).
